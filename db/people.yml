  bio: Elizabeth grew up in Northern Virginia and earned her bachelors degree from
    Stanford University in 2016, studying engineering physics and computer science.
    After starting her Ph.D. in applied physics at Columbia, she joined the Billinge
    group in fall 2017. She is excited to apply PDF techniques to the characterization
    of superatom systems and other novel materials. In her spare time she enjoys making
    soup and singing barbershop music.
