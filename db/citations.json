In addition, they share similarities with the cuprate and iron-pnictide high-Tc compounds, such as planar metal-oxygen sheets, electron/hole-symmetric electron configurations (3d1 and 3d9), and close proximity of density wave and superconducting orders, thus making them intriguing systems to study to gain insight into unconventional superconductivity. BaTi2(As,Sb)2O is a prototypical layered oxy-pnictide system known to have either CDW or SDW ordering for all compositions and superconductivity below 1 K for the Sb endmember. However, it has remained unclear whether the order is CDW or SDW. To investigate this, we have performed muon spin relaxation/rotation and x-ray/neutron total scattering measurements on several specimens. Zero-field muon spin relaxation measurements show no significant increase in relaxation rate at the density wave ordering temperature, indicating that the system undergoes CDW rather than SDW order.

Billinge"], "details": "Short-range magnetic correlations play a crucial role in a variety of condensed matter phenomena, yet they remain notoriously difficult to investigate experimentally. Quantitative analysis of the diffuse scattering of neutrons from local magnetic correlations represents a viable but challenging route toward revealing short-range magnetic order in complex materials. Reverse Monte Carlo techniques that iteratively fit randomly generated structural models in momentum space have been used successfully, demonstrating that diffuse magnetic scattering can be rich in information[1-2]. Recently [3], we developed an alternative real-space approach to investigating local magnetic correlations, which we call magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis in analogy to the more familiar atomic pair distribution function. This experimentally accessible and intuitive quantity reveals magnetic correlations directly in real space and places diffuse and Bragg scattering on an equal footing, thereby gaining sensitivity to both short- and long-range magnetic order. In this talk we will present the basic theory behind mPDF analysis and provide several examples of its utility using both simulated and experimentally measured data on several magnetic systems, including a canonical antiferromagnetic, a spin glass, and a spin ice. We discuss the potential impact that mPDF methods may have on current and future research interests in magnetism.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.A.M. Paddison and A.L. Goodwin. Phys. Rev.

Our follow-up\nstudy of the lattice dynamics using inelastic neutron scattering (INS)\n[2] shows that the lattice dynamics are responsive to the local\nsymmetry broken phase observed by PDF, giving not only key insights\ninto the behavior of PbTe, but also revealing INS as a powerful tool\nfor studying local structure. Below room temperature our INS results\nare in good agreement with earlier work on PbTe [3], and we also see\nthe significantly anharmonic signal of the zone center mode reported\nby Delaire et al. [4]. The new result of the INS study is the\nobservation of the unexpected appearance on warming of a new zone\ncenter phonon branch in PbTe. In a harmonic solid the number of phonon\nbranches is strictly determined by the contents and symmetry of the\nunit cell. The appearance of the new mode indicates a crossover to a\ndynamic lower symmetry structure with increasing temperature. While no\nstructural transition is seen crystallographically, the appearance of\nthe new mode in inelastic neutron scattering coincides with the\nobservation of fluctuating Pb off-centering dipoles seen in the local\nstructure. The observation resembles relaxor ferroelectricity, however, since there are no inhomogeneous dopants in pure PbTe, this\nanomalous behavior is an intrinsic response of the system. The results\ncannot be explained within the framework of conventional phase\ntransition theories such as soft-mode theory and challenges our basic\nunderstanding of the physics of materials. The observations made will\nguide more thorough understanding of why PbTe has an anomalously low\nthermal conductivity at elevated temperature resulting in a rather\nhigh TE figure of merit. We suggest that new thermoelectrics should be\nsought among materials that, like PbTe [1], are close to a\nferroelectric instability.\n[1] E.S.

A diverse array of complex materials and structures are at the frontier of contemporary materials\nscience, solid state physics and chemistry. Notably, modern functional materials, even when they are\ncrystalline, display substantial deviations from perfect periodicity, and often these deviations critically\ninfuence the properties. Often, even sub Angstrom changes in inter-atomic bond lengths have profound\nconsequences for the chemistry and functionality of these structure-sensitive materials. These\nmaterials increasingly take advantage of low dimensionality, confined geometries, such as nanomaterials, and disorder to yield useful/desired properties.To fully understand, design, and utilize these\nmaterials, it is essential to perform high precision structural characterization at the nanoscale. Crystallographic\nmethods are the gold standard for atomic structure determination. However, a broad\nand growing class of materials and/or nanophase morphologies do not yield to a crystallographic\nanalysis, due to the appreciable diffuse scattering component and broad and overlapped Bragg-peaks.\nNanoscale structure characterization therefore requires methods that go beyond conventional crystallographic\ntreatment.\nThis lecture will provide an overview of one of the tools at our disposal to tackle the nanoscale\nstructure problem - the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. As a direct space method\noriginally designed to study structure of glasses, liquids and amorphous materials, the PDF approach\nhas more recently gained popularity when extended (and with noticeable success) to study nanoscale\nstructure in bulk, nanoporous, and nanocrystalline materias. The PDF is based on a Sine Fourier\ntransform of powder diffraction data obtained in total-scattering experiments that include both Bragg\nand diffuse scattering components. When advanced synchrotron based X-ray and neutron probes are\nused, access to very high values of momentum transfer, Q, is possible, which in turn provides high\ndirect-space resolution. A series of simple examples based on real experimental PDF will be used, aimed to introduce the method to the novice, to highlight the type and the richness of information\navailable, and to demonstrate some of the ways the structural information can be extracted. Special\nemphasis will be given to practical aspects that should be kept in mind when planning a successful\nexperiment. These will include various effects affecting the PDF, such as scattering contrast and the\nprobe choice, Q-space resolution, temperature, finite particle size, and correlated motion of the nearest\nneighbors.

Characterization of one of the key ingredients, the atomic\nstructure, in materials whose relevant structural order extends only to nanometer\nlength-scales prompts utilization of methods complementary to conventional crystallography, such as neutron and X-ray scattering based atomic pair distribution function (PDF). The\nPDF approach, originally used to study short range order in liquids and glasses, and\nsuccessfully extended over the past two decades to study the atomic structure on multiple\nlength-scales in a broad spectrum of crystalline materials, has finally made a full circle\nby recently being applied to nanocrystalline systems as well. The approach enabled the new\nway of grasping the structural complexities and understanding the properties. In this talk\nI will focus on utilization of the PDF to study nanoscale atomic structure/property relationships\nin bulk materials through selected PDF results on systems exhibiting nanoscale effects from large\n(\u201cobvious\u201d) to small (subtle).

For this purpose, in situ studies of particle synthesis have in recent years proven extremely powerful, and important knowledge has been obtained using e.g. PXRD and SAXS.[1] However, to fully understand how a material crystallize from an aqueous solution, a liquid or an amorphous precursor, it is necessary to probe the atomic structural changes during the initial nucleating and crystallization. For this, Total Scattering (TS) is perfectly suited. TS provides information on both short and long range order, and it is possible to extract the atomic structure of both amorphous and crystalline compounds. With the advent of the RAPDF method, total scattering patterns can be obtained within seconds, and in situ studies are therefore feasible. [2]\nHere, some of our most recent results from in situ total scattering studies\nof hydrothermal synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles will be presented. We\nuse a small capillary reactor for studies of hydrothermal and solvothermal\nsyntheses and can study reactions taking place in water or other solvents at\nelevated temperatures and pressures. Specifically, we have recently\ninvestigated the hydrothermal formation of SnO2, [3] CeO2, [4] ZrO2, TiO2 and\nFe2O3, which are all of technological relevance. From Pair Distribution\nFunction (PDF) analysis of the in situ total scattering data, we have been\nable to identify the structures of the ionic complexes in the precursors as\nwell as the amorphous nanoclusters that appear before full crystallization.\nBy following the transformation of these structures to crystalline materials, we can deduce formation mechanisms of functional materials. The studies\nreveal the changes in material characteristics (atomic structure, particle\nsize/shape/distributions, crystallinity) throughout the synthesis to give a\ncomprehensive description, which may be used to design particles for\nsyntheses on a  larger scale.\n[1] Sun, Y. and Ren, Y.

Recently we have developed PyGSAS, a library of\nPython bindings that allow GSAS to be run as part of the SrRietveld application\ndeveloped as part of the NSF funded DANSE (Distributed Data Analysis for Neutron\nScattering Experiments, http://danse.us/) software development project. SrRietveld\nallows control of Rietveld refinements via Python language scripts and thus perform\nautomatic refinements on single or multiple datasets. SrRietveld is designed to\nfacilitate new science by processing large amounts of data that will be measured at\nthe powerful POWGEN3 diffractometer at the Spallation Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory. PyGSAS can be used independently of SrRietveld and users can easily build\ntheir own applications using PyGSAS. PyGSAS not only provides a new way of running\nRietveld refinements with GSAS, but also brings new science by handling large amount of\ndata. We will discuss several examples of using PyGSAS with real experimental data.", "entrytype": "article", "grant": "applying for support", "journal": "ICNS, International Conference on Neutron Scattering 2009, Knoxville, TN", "nb": "poster, conf", "note": "", "pages": "May 3-7", "title": "PyGSAS: python binding program on GSAS", "wwwhome": "http://www.mrs.org/s_mrs/sec.asp?CID=18023&DID=231750", "year": "2009"}, "_id": "pt090501"}

Among the applications of Rietveld method, General Structure Analysis System\n(GSAS) and FullProf are the most widely used programs to analyze diffraction data from x-ray and neutron\npowder diffraction experiments. However, they are challenged by modern high throughput experiments that\ngenerate hundreds of datasets because the workflow is highly human intensive. SrRietveld is the Rietveld\nrefinement flagship application in the NSF funded DANSE (Distributed Data Analysis for Neutron Scattering\nExperiments) project (http://danse.us).  It was developed to serve the needs of the POWGEN neutron powder\ndiffractometer that is under construction at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which will have unprecedented throughput producing large numbers of datasets from samples as a function of\nparameters such as temperature pressure and magnetic field.  However, it is also useful in a wide variety\nof structure refinement problems, wherever FullProf or GSAS are currently used. SrRietveld wraps GSAS and\nFullProf in a Python programming environment automating many of the tedious hands-on tasks that are currently\nnecessary to control a refinement. GSAS or FullProf can be selected as the refinement engine and can handle\nsequential refinement automatically. Additional applications can also be built using the SrRietveld software\nlibrary by expert users.

Complex materials have   complicated structures, large\nunit cells and multiple chemical species.  They are often\nnanostructured:   nanoparticulate, nanoporous, or having nanoscale\nchemical or electronic inhomogeneities or nanoscale  structural\ndistortions.  A great challenge in researching these materials is to\ncharacterize their   structure.  Apart from the issue that the\nstructure is inherently complicated, structures on the  nanoscale\ncannot be solved using our tried and trusted technique of\ncrystallography, the so-called  nanostructure problem.  We don't have\nrobust tools for solving the structure of precisely the  complex\nnanomaterials that we want to engineer.  A number of candidate\ntechniques are emerging based   on scattering techniques.  These make\nuse of the most modern powerful sources of x-rays, neutrons and\nx-rays.

TSPDF uses short wavelength x-rays to obtain a\nscattering pattern of sufficient quality that it can be Fourier\ntransformed to obtain a meaningful real-space pair distribution\nfunction that shows the distribution of atomic distances in the solid.\nWe found that the approach is highly promising and provides additional\ninformation not available in a conventional XRD approach in the case of\namorphous API's.

These contain many elements, contain defects that are critical to the\nproperties and are structured at the nanoscale.  They are generally manufactured into complicated heterogeneous\ndevices with sub-micron sized features and as functioning materials change over time as the device functions.

Because of the complexity of structural solutions it will often be\nnecessary to have complementary data from more than one method and software that can handle the heterogeneous data in\na coherent modeling scheme, something we are calling Complex Modeling.

Just as nature uses highly complex proteins to design in highly specific functionality, our synthetic materials, both inorganic and organic, are also increasing in complexity. A full understanding of the structure-property relationship requires us to go beyond traditional crystallography and to study the local structure, which is a major experimental challenge. There are recently emerging powerful experimental developments, for example, using the atomic pair distribution function technique (PDF), among others.  However a general problem is that the information content in the data is limited, and often decreases with increasing structural complexity of the material, whereas the degrees of freedom needed to fully describe the structure increase.  This rapidly leads to an information gap, and the nanostructure inverse problem becomes ill-posed. This is a critical bottleneck for understanding materials at the complexity frontier.  It is an applied math and computational problem as much as an experimental one, and one where modern computation and AM developments such as uncertainty quantification, can be expected to have a transformative role.  I will discuss some of these issues and our efforts to address them, highlighting our computational and algorithmic needs.\n\nI will describe Complex Modeling which is an attempt to close the information gap in cases where the inverse problem is ill posed.  This requires encoding and complexing data sources that are complementary to the basic scattering data to arrive at a robust and unique structure solution.  We are exploring the use of data analytical approaches to address this problem.

PDFs may be calculated numerically from structures directly in real-space, and this has often been the approach, but in certain cases, which are becoming more important and frequently encountered in practice, it is better to calculate the scattering from a model directly from the DSE, and then Fourier transform it to compare with experimentally determined PDFs.

Billinge", "Ben Frandsen"], "details": "Short-range magnetic correlations are known to exist in a variety of strongly correlated electron systems, but our understanding of the role they play is challenged by the difficulty of experimentally probing such correlations. Magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis is a newly developed neutron total scattering method that can reveal short-range magnetic correlations directly in real space, and may therefore help ameliorate this difficulty [1,2].\n\nAfter a brief introduction to the mPDF method, we present temperature-dependent mPDF measurements of the short-range magnetic correlations in the paramagnetic phase of antiferromagnetic MnO, an archetypal strongly correlated transition-metal oxide. In addition to recovering the expected long-range magnetic structure at low temperature, we observe significant correlations on a \u223c1~nm length scale persisting into the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. With no free parameters, ab initio calculations using the self-interaction-corrected local spin density approximation of density functional theory quantitatively reproduce the high-temperature magnetic correlations to a high degree of accuracy. These results yield valuable insight into the magnetic exchange in MnO and showcase the utility of the mPDF technique for studying magnetic properties of strongly correlated electron systems.  This work will appear in PRL (available on arXiv) [3].\n\nWe will also discuss mPDF results from other strongly correlated electron systems.\n\n1.\tB. A. Frandsen, X. Yang, and S. J. L.

Billinge"], "details": "The LCLS takes x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy experiments to a new level, allowing for femtosecond time-resolved studies, studies of tiny sample volumes with kinematical radiation, and resulting in completely novel insights into the behavior of materials.  When material structure is long-range ordered in crystals, diffraction signals are sharply peaked in reciprocal space and it is best to study the materials directly in reciprocal space.  When the structural coherence is low, on the nanoscale, diffraction features are spread out into diffuse scattering and can become difficult to see.  A powerful approach in this situation is to measure data over a wide range of reciprocal-space and Fourier transform it to real-space, where the information is sharply peaked.  The range in Q that is measured is directly related to the resolution in real-space that you obtain, meaning that high-Q measurements are preferred.  The signal in the high-Q region can be very weak, but is also of great importance scientifically, as I will illustrate in the talk.  LCLS-II-HE will completely open a new window for this kind of measurement in ultra-fast mode, and in other interesting situations, as I will discuss.

This is due to the confluence of three factors.  First sources of x-rays and neutrons suitable for PDF work have become increasingly powerful.  Second, computing, software and algorithms for PDF data analysis and modeling have grown in power and capability.  Finally, the world has realized that not all materials are perfect crystals, and if we can make them nano-sized, or incorporate and engineer non-periodic defects, or work with even highly disordered materials, that we can engineer super-materials that can do way more things, better than crystals.  It is precisely these materials that are ideal for study with total-scattering and PDF methods.\nIn this talk, I will introduce total scattering and PDF methods, highlighting recent methodological developments that we believe can have significant impacts in research and in industry.
