    - No particular experience required but a keen interest in using, or learning
      to use, computers to analyze data to answer interesting scientific questions.
      Experience in coding in python is a plus as is any experience with data analysis,
      including AI, and machine learning.

  description: We love having undergraduate researchers in our lab! There are multiple
    opportunities in the group for summer or semester-time research to learn how to
    understand atomic arrangements on the nanoscale (a billionth of a meter) and the
    relationship of these to properties of those materials.  In the group we study
    a wide range of materials, from the applied (HIV pharmaceuticals) to the pure
    science (understanding novel magnetic and superconducting properties of exotic
    quantum materials with no known applications).  Depending on your interests there
    are likely to be various options available to work on.  What all the projects
    have in common is the use of computers to carry out advanced data analysis.  No
    prior experience is required for these positions, but for success it is necessary
    that you have an interest in learning how to use advanced computing, including
    for example, machine learning, AI and other statistical methods to answer real
    scientific questions.  Experience in these areas, and in programming in Python,
    is even better.
